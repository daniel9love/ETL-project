# ETL-project
Harmony, Robert and Daniel's baller transformation of COVID-19/Weather data which could potentially save lives. What did you do with your Saturday morning?

We are looking to create a Database of confirmed cases for the Corona Virus combined with Weather Data from those areas to see if there is a correllation between weather and the number of confirmed cases.

# Data Sets used for our Database

Data Set #1 used is from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases

The CSV gathered includes the Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) epidemiological data since 22 January 2020 to current. 

Fields available within the data include Province/State, Country/Region, Latitude and Longitude, Date of Last Update, Confirmed, Suspected, Recovered, Deaths.  For our purposes for this project we are only using the Confirmed cases. 

Data Set #2 used is from http://ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search

The CSV gathered includes Weather Data during the same sampled time frame. 

Fields available include State/Country, Latitude and Longitude, Precipitation, Minimum, Maximum and Average Temp for our chosen date ranges.
